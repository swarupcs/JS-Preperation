# Debounce

https://www.greatfrontend.com/interviews/study/three-months/questions/javascript/debounce


Debouncing is a technique used to control how many times we allow a function to be executed over time. When a JavaScript function is debounced with a wait time of X milliseconds, it must wait until after X milliseconds have elapsed since the debounced function was last called.

You almost certainly have encountered debouncing in your daily lives before (e.g. when entering an elevator). Only after X duration of not pressing the "Door open" button (the debounced function not being called) will the elevator door actually close (the callback function is executed).

Implement a `debounce` function which accepts a callback function and a `wait` duration. Calling `debounce()` returns a function which has debounced invocations of the callback function following the behavior described above.

## Examples

```js
let i = 0;
function increment() {
  i++;
}
const debouncedIncrement = debounce(increment, 100);

// t = 0: Call debouncedIncrement().
debouncedIncrement(); // i = 0

// t = 50: i is still 0 because 100ms have not passed.

// t = 100: increment() was invoked and i is now 1.
```

`debouncedIncrement()` is called multiple times.

```js
let i = 0;
function increment() {
  i++;
}
const debouncedIncrement = debounce(increment, 100);

// t = 0: Call debouncedIncrement().
debouncedIncrement(); // i = 0

// t = 50: i is still 0 because 100ms have not passed.
//  Call debouncedIncrement() again.
debouncedIncrement(); // i = 0

// t = 100: i is still 0 because it has only
//  been 50ms since the last debouncedIncrement() at t = 50.

// t = 150: Because 100ms have passed since
//  the last debouncedIncrement() at t = 50,
//  increment was invoked and i is now 1 .
```

# 🎉 FINAL RESULT

Even though you called debouncedIncrement() **two times**, the real increment() runs **once**, only after the user stops calling for 100ms.

# 🧠 **SUPER SIMPLE SUMMARY**

* First call: schedules run at t=100
* Second call happens early: cancels old timer
* New run is scheduled at t=150
* increment() runs ONLY ONCE at t=150

## Follow up

* Debounce with a `cancel()` method to cancel delayed invocations and a `flush()` method to immediately invoke them.
* Implement `throttle`, which is similar to debounce but a little different.

# Solution

Debounce, along with throttle, are among the most common front end interview questions; it's the front end equivalent of inverting a binary tree. Hence you should make sure that you are very familiar with the question.

## Solution
Given that there's a `wait` duration before the function can be invoked, we know that we will need a timer, and `setTimeout` is the first thing that comes to mind.

We will also need to return a function which wraps around the callback function parameter. This function needs to do a few things:

### 1. Debounce invocation
It invokes the callback function only after a delay of `wait`. This is performed using `setTimeout`. Since we might need to clear the timer if the debounced function is called again while there's a pending invocation, we need to retain a reference to a `timeoutID`, which is the returned value of `setTimeout`.  
If the function is called again while there's a pending invocation, we should cancel existing timers and schedule a new timer for the delayed invocation with the full `wait` duration. We can cancel the timer via `clearTimeout(timeoutID)`.

### 2. Calls the callback function with the right parameters
Debounced functions are used like the original functions, so we should forward the value of `this` and function arguments when invoking the original callback functions.

You may be tempted to use `func(...args)` but **this will be lost** if callback functions are invoked that way. Hence we have to use **Function.prototype.apply()** / **Function.prototype.call()** which allows us to specify `this` as the first argument.



- `func.apply(thisArg, args)`
- `func.call(thisArg, ...args)`



```js
/**
 * @param {Function} func
 * @param {number} wait
 * @return {Function}
 */
export default function debounce(func, wait = 0) {
  let timeoutID = null;
  return function (...args) {
    // Keep a reference to `this` so that
    // func.apply() can access it.
    const context = this;
    clearTimeout(timeoutID);

    timeoutID = setTimeout(function () {
      timeoutID = null; // Not strictly necessary but good to do this.
      func.apply(context, args);
    }, wait);
  };
}
````

## Edge cases

The main pitfall in this question is invoking the callback function with the correct `this`, the value of `this` when the debounced function was called. Since the callback function will be invoked in a timeout, we need to ensure that the first argument to `func.apply()` / `func.call()` is the right value. There are two ways to achieve this:

### 1. Using a variable to store `this`

Use another variable to keep a reference to `this` and access `this` via that variable from within the setTimeout callback. This is the traditional way of preserving `this` before arrow functions existed.

### 2. Using an arrow function inside setTimeout

Use an arrow function to declare the setTimeout callback where the `this` value within it has lexical scope. The value of `this` within arrow functions is bound to the context in which the function is created, not to the environment in which the function is called.

```js
/**
 * @callback func
 * @param {number} wait
 * @return {Function}
 */
export default function debounce(func, wait = 0) {
  let timeoutID = null;
  return function (...args) {
    clearTimeout(timeoutID);

    timeoutID = setTimeout(() => {
      timeoutID = null; // Not strictly necessary but good to include.
      // Has the same `this` as the outer function's
      // as it's within an arrow function.
      func.apply(this, args);
    }, wait);
  };
}
```

Also, we should **not** implement the returned function using an arrow function for reasons mentioned above. The `this` value of the returned function needs to be dynamically determined when executed.

Read this article for a more in-depth explanation.

## Techniques

* Using setTimeout
* Closures
* How `this` works
* Invoking functions via Function.prototype.apply() / Function.prototype.call()

## Notes

clearTimeout() is a forgiving function and passing an invalid ID to clearTimeout() silently does nothing; no exception is thrown. Hence we don't have to check for `timeoutID === null` before using clearTimeout().
